English.js
==========

### GeoIP based spelling correction between EN-GB &amp; EN-US

Introducing English.js, a JavaScript library which quietly converts text on your webpage to either Commonwealth English (aka British English) or American English depending on where you access the page from. â€‹English.JS uses a GeoIP service called hostip.info to determine where you are, and then adjusts the spelling of certain key words accordingly.

Write your content in EN-GB or EN-US, whichever you normally would, but spare yourself the annoyance of having pedantic people on either side of the Atlantic complaining that color/colour is spelled/spelt wrong.



### Setup:

1. Include "English.js" in your page. 
2. Initialize the EnglishJS plugin once the DOM has loaded:

```javascript
// EnglishJS will detect your location and display text in either Commonwealth
// or American English depending on which is most suitable
EnglishJS(); 

// Alternatively pass through the country you wish to localise/localize 
// for and EnglishJS will pick accordingly.
EnglishJS("GB");
// or
EnglishJS("US");
```

### Who gets what?

Visitors that hostip.info identify as coming from the following countries get Commonwealth English, and everyone else (including people who's location is unkown) gets American English.
